# python-pp
Python++ is a small personal project of mine. Be aware that this was written on Windows and for Windows.
The way to use it is to open CMD and pass the directory of .pypp file with code as an argument to the executable.

Features:
- variable declaration
- functions
- if statement
- for and while loops (for loop is in development)
- objects
- native functions (print, min, max, sqrt, cbrt, sleep)
- integrated stopwatch (timerStart(), timerStop(), timerDuration()); timerDuration returns an object with microseconds and milliseconds
